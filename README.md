## üöÄ The Vision

Vattles is a first-of-its-kind competitive platform at the nexus of three explosive trends: **AI content creation, community-driven gaming, and the learn-to-code movement.**

We are forging a new digital frontier‚Äîa world where the line between developer, artist, and competitor dissolves. We're building the global arena where the fusion of human ingenuity and artificial intelligence is the most thrilling eSport of our time. A place where the merit of an idea, executed with speed, skill, and pure *vibe*, determines the champion.

## ‚ú® Core Features (MVP)

The current build focuses on delivering the complete, core gameplay loop.

*   üë§ **User Authentication & Profiles:** Secure sign-up/log-in with a simple profile page tracking W/L ratio and battle history.
*   ‚öîÔ∏è **Battle Creation & Lobby:** A dynamic dashboard to discover, spectate, or join open Vattles.
*   üíª **The Live Vattle Arena:** A purpose-built workspace with a countdown timer, vibe prompt, and curated links to free-to-use AI generation tools.
*   üó≥Ô∏è **Community-Powered Voting:** A side-by-side interface for the community to interact with both live app demos and cast their vote.
*   üèÜ **Results & Permanent Replays:** Every battle generates a shareable replay page to showcase the results and creations, building an evergreen content library.

## How It Works: The Vattle Flow

1.  **CHALLENGE:** A user initiates a Vattle, defining a theme (e.g., "Minimalist Music Player"), a time limit (e.g., 1 hour), and opens it as a challenge.
2.  **CREATE:** Two Vattlers accept the challenge. The clock starts. They must use their coding skills and free AI tools to build and deploy a live web app that best captures the vibe.
3.  **VOTE:** Submissions are locked. The community and spectators can now interact with both live app demos, side-by-side. They vote on which app better fulfills the theme and has the superior "vibe."
4.  **VICTORY:** Votes are tallied, a winner is declared, and the battle replay is archived for all to see.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Vattles is being built with a modern, scalable, and powerful tech stack.

*   **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
